# Platooning

10.08.18

The repository contains datasets of vehicle platooning scenarios to be investigated via machine learning [1]. Two simulation environments are used: 1. differential equations of [2] and 2. plexe.

A presentation is present to introduce the problem and some examples. 

Code of 1. is reported in the repository, for 2. please refer to plexe.car2x.org/.
